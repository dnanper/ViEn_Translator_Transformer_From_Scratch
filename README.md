# ViEn_Translator Project Overview

This repository contains solutions for two main problems in Vietnamese-English Neural Machine Translation (NMT).

## Problem 1: Transformer-based NMT

- Implements a complete Transformer architecture for Vietnamese-English translation.
- Includes custom tokenizer (SentencePiece), data processing, training, inference, and evaluation scripts.
- Focuses on high-quality translation with BLEU evaluation.
- See `Problem 1/README.md` for detailed usage and workflow.

## Problem 2: Large Language Model Fine-tuning

- Fine-tunes a large pre-trained language model (e.g., Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B) for medical translation using LoRA and streaming data loading.
- Optimized for modern GPUs and large datasets.
- Includes bidirectional and dynamic prompting strategies.
- See `Problem 2/README.md` for instructions and details.
